# Flutter Momento Moderated Chat App

A Flutter version of the Momento Moderated Chat demo. It currently only has a macOS implementation, but more are coming soon.

## Prerequisites
Flutter. It can be installed by following the instructions [here](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install).

### macOS
For mac specifically, you will need the Flutter SDK, [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/), and [CocoaPods](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html#installation).

## Running the Demo
From the flutter moderated_chat directory, call `flutter run` to start the app:
```bash
cd flutter/moderated_chat
flutter run -d macos
```
Alternatively, you can open the project in VSCode or IntelliJ with the Flutter plugin and run the app from there.
